# bankaccountmgmt-project


Created a basic bank account system in Python using object-oriented programming. The main BankAccount class has private attributes for account numbers and balances, which can only be accessed through specific methods like get_balance and deposit.
I also made two subclasses: SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount. each with a specific attribute so I could practice different implementations.
The SavingsAccount class includes an interest rate and ensures withdrawals donâ€™t overdraw the account, while the CheckingAccount class adds a fee for each withdrawal. 
This project helped me practice encapsulation, inheritance, and handling common banking operations.
